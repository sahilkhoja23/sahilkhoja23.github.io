                    <h3 class="pfblock1-description">Leave No Trace is a mobile application that allows users to track their energy usage and reduce their overall carbon footprint. The concept was awarded 'Best in Nation' in the Verizon Innovative Application Challenege by the Verizon Foundation. The award gave us a grant of $20,000 to develop the application, so we partnered with MIT's Media Lab and University of Texas - Dallas to build the product. </h3>
                    
                    
                    <h2 style="text-align:left; margin-bottom:0.2em;">Google Play Store</h2>
                    <h3 class="pfblock1-description">I was the lead product designer in creating the interfaces and interactions of the application. We had worked with MIT's Media Lab to build out a prototype for the
        <a style="color:#666;" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=appinventor.ai_ann_root.LNT&hl=en"><u>Google Play Store</u></a> but it wasn't what we expected. We had no prgramming skills whatsoever, and therefore had to create the app using MIT's 'drag-and-drop' solution. Here's how our 'compare yourself to the globe feature' looked like:
                    
                    <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-sm-offset-4 col-md-12 col-md-offset-4 col-lg-12 col-lg-offset-4">
                    <div>
                        <figure style="padding-bottom:2em">
                            <img src="assets/images/unnamed.webp" alt="img01"/>

                </div>  
                    
     
                        It didn't meet our standards, and we were unhappy with this version 1.0. So, we used the grant money to partner with the University of Texas - Dallas to build the product the way we invisioned it. </h3>

                    <h3 class="pfblock1-description">I sat down with the team from UTD to whiteboard some ideas along with creating wireframes and flows for the application. While I took care of the design, Sameer, Kunz, and Henry (UTD) began the development.</h3>

                    <h3 class="pfblock1-description">After going back and forth with the team at UTD, we had built out an iOS version with limited features. But it had the core functionality that we were hoping for: tracking your energy usage. Here's how it turned out:</h3>

                     <h2 style="text-align:left; margin-bottom:0.2em; margin-top:1em;">Why?</h2>
                    <h3 class="pfblock1-description">I wanted to keep the experience of the app visual and simple for several reasons. Based on surveys and user testing we conducted, many people didn't know how to parse their energy bills and then transfer that information to our app. Therefore, we kept the interface with a very limited amount of variables, and even gave users to shorten the different types of energy usage they had to manually input. In addition, the trends are best described by line graphs, typically used whenever dealing with change over time. I still think that giving users some sort of swipe tutorial or tooltips would help explain energy units that people aren't familiar with, but its something we can add in the 2.0!</h3>
