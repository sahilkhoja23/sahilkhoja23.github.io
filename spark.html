                    <h2 style="text-align:left; margin-bottom:0.2em;">Overview</h2>
                    <h3 class="pfblock1-description">Spark was conceived and designed during the Money 20/20 Hackathon in 24 hours with Mathew Black, Sameer Khoja, and Aalyan Rajwani. The idea was based on the Ice Bucket Challenge, except you could design any challenge and and proceeds would go towards a cause that you cared about. The purpose was to reduce the friction that people come across when trying to donate to a cause, since many people don't know the organizations/non-profits/NGO's associated with the cause. We wanted to create a fun way to leverage the virality of the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge to support all organizations alike.</h3>
                    
                    
                    <h2 style="text-align:left; margin-bottom:0.2em;">Role</h2>
                    <h3 class="pfblock1-description">I was the primary designer in creating the interfaces and interactions of the application. This was my first time developing any sort of iOS Application, but I was finally able to put the Swift I had learned to use :)</h3>
                    
                    <h2 style="text-align:left; margin-bottom:0.2em;">Initial Sketches</h2>
                    <h3 class="pfblock1-description">When desinging a social media application that includes payments, things can get pretty messy pretty quickly. Therefore, I wanted to adapt UI's that people were already accustomed to, such as Venmo for a global ledger and Twitter for composing short messages. Here's some of the messy-ness:</h3>

                    <h3 class="pfblock1-description">I'm not a big fan of illustrator, and I love the push that the design community and more have made to switch over to Sketch. It's my primary design tool and it definitely didn't fall short when designing this application or exporting the artboards to Xcode. Here's how my final wireframe turned out:</h3>
                    
                    <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-sm-offset-12 col-md-12 col-md-offset-12 col-lg-12 col-lg-offset-0">

                </div>
                </div>                
                
                     <h2 style="text-align:left; margin-bottom:0.2em; margin-top:1em;">Implementation</h2>
                    <h3 class="pfblock1-description">There were a ton of changes, especially to the user interface, within 24 hours. First, the causes page. I had initially used emojis to describe causes, but after testing the page with users, many people were confused as to what each emoji represented. Our team fixed the issue by developing custom icons to represent the causes that people could support. Another central issue was crating a 'Spark'. Each Spark had 4 parameters: the challenge, duration of the challenge, the amount one would have to give if they didn't complete the challenge, and the cause. My initial design was very similar to composing an email, as an email has a similar amount of parameters. But it didn't seem interactive, or fun. Many people associate email with work, and we definitely didn't want our app to seem like work. Especially since you're being requesting to give money. Here's how that process ended up, along with the work in Xcode:</h3>
                   
                    
                    <div class="row">

                    <h3 class="pfblock1-description">After finding many old segueways, tinkering with the camera, and ensuring that every single button led to something that existed, we had created Spark. I think that the 'Create Spark' could have been implemented better. but I'm glad I had an experience where I was given a set of parameters and had to come up with a solution in 24 hours. Designing with multiple variables can be difficult, but who doesn't like a challenge? Check out the app below:</h3>
